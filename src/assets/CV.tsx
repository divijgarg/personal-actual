Our goal was to develop an end-to-end solution for microgravity propellant transfer. This work involved validating results against published benchmarks and performing detailed thermal and pressure analyses. In addition to simulation work, I conducted design reviews, lead risk analyses and mitigation planning, and manage budgeting efforts. Our team was selected as a finalist in NASA's annual HuLC competition, showcasing advanced understanding of cryogenic systems and fluid dynamics. We won the Best Technical Presentation Award at the competition.",
