          When questioning the wisdom of Shakespeare, one has to be careful.
          After all, he basically shaped all of modern-day literature. His
          quotes are innumerable. He’s revered by every English teacher in
          existence. But, when mathematics gets involved, his logic falters. Let
          me explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite mental exercises is justifying widely accepted
          ideas. I hate the notion that we should simply accept facts. For
          example, a widespread claim amongst astronomers in the 20th century
          was that stars near the edge of galaxies orbit the center of galaxies
          slower than stars near the center. No one had actually observed this —
          they based it on our own solar system. Planets like Neptune orbited
          the Sun slower than Mercury, so astronomers generalized this to stars
          around the centers of galaxies.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Yet, when Vera Rubin actually took observations of galaxies, she saw
          that stars orbited the centers at the same speed, unlike planets
          around the Sun. This led to the groundbreaking discovery of dark
          matter, and it completely changed our understanding of the universe —
          of our own existence. Thus, questioning assumptions matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          A while ago, in the spirit of such mental torture, I thought of a
          pretty standard claim in math: 0! = 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew this claim was true, centuries of mathematics had established
          this, but I couldn’t figure out why. What does 0! represent? Can I
          really order 0 objects? I eventually read a textbook for the answer to
          my predicament, and the reasoning mathematicians used was, well,
          surprising. Say you have 0 people. The number of ways to order them,
          or 0!, is just one. You do nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Do NOTHING? That’s an option?? Seems like I’ve always been told to do
          SOMETHING. High school, college apps, college, teach us to constantly
          work hard, do a lot of activities, take courses, play sports, tutor on
          weekends, find internships, volunteer, get published, get a job, shake
          hands with the president, have tea with the King, go to Mars, eat,
          shower, brush, sleep, repeat, but doing nothing? That’s not really
          been an option. Yet, here it was. Being used by professional
          mathematicians. And with it, I remembered something.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          “To do anything, it is first necessary to be doing nothing” — Nancy
          Hale.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In our world, there’s always something to be completed, some task
          that’s due. Yet, our brains are most productive when we’re not
          multitasking. We can’t solve the 7 — well now 6 — unsolved problems in
          math while worrying about a job interview and climbing Mount Everest.
          To truly make progress, we sometimes need to stop. Choose to do
          nothing. Let our brains truly relax, meditate, breathe, and let the
          solution come to us. The best math competitions I’ve had are when the
          night before, I did absolutely nothing (except eat some chocolate).
          Completely relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Now, my title. I disagree with Shakespeare. In his infinite wisdom, he
          said that
        </p>
        <p> “Nothing will come of nothing” </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          And honestly, that’s nonsense. Yes, 0!=1 is probably irrelevant to 70%
          of the people out there. Yes, it probably just seems like 0 is too
          excited. But it teaches us a lesson: to do nothing is an option, and
          when used correctly, it is extremely beneficial. The value of 0!
          equaling one is indescribable to mathematics — I could write a whole
          article about that. But, just like anything in life, you can’t use
          this logic everywhere. Vera Rubin wouldn’t have discovered dark matter
          if she did nothing all the time. Shakespeare wouldn’t have enlightened
          us if he did nothing all the time. When used sparingly, though, doing
          nothing allows us to reset. Reevaluate our thinking. Approach problems
          with a fresh state of mind. As 2023 approaches, let us use it wisely,
          and in doing so, aim to do something.

    title: "High School Clubs Should Be Student-Led. ",
    desc: "",
    date: "July 29, 2022",
    content: (
      <VStack textAlign="left" spacing="20px" w="80%" fontFamily="open-sans">
        <p>
          Before I give my argument for why student-led clubs are a must for
          high schools, I think it’s important to understand why clubs exist in
          the first place. High school clubs are aimed at letting students
          explore niche and interesting areas that wouldn’t really be taught in
          their classes. A great example are clubs like Business Professionals
          of America (BPA) and Robotics — such organizations heavily focus on a
          specific subject and allow students to dive into a more interesting
          perspective. But of course, there’s another part of clubs that’s
          equally important: social interaction and personal development. In
          meetings and competitions, students get to meet others with similar
          interests and form long-lasting friendships — I mean literally, half
          of my friendships were formed through clubs. And alongside that, they
          develop skills that will aid them through college and into the
          workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, there’s a certain restriction on clubs. High schools require
          teachers to oversee the organizations, and in most high schools, this
          leads to the teachers planning out club meetings, selecting who goes
          to competitions, and essentially overseeing the entire club. Some
          teachers nominate one or two student leaders to help them in this
          process, but beyond that, students are usually just participants. Of
          course, there’s nothing wrong with this method. Members still get to
          be in the club, meet new people, and learn about something they’re
          interested in. My sophomore year BPA club was just like this and we
          had a lot of fun. But then came my Junior and Senior year math team.
          With 9 student leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though it seemed daunting to handle an entire club, I eventually
          came to love that responsibility. Why? Because of the skills I
          developed as a captain. Not only did I mature (something that the
          Class of 2026 and 2027 desperately need), but I also became a better
          decision maker. I had to make important choices such as who went to
          competitions and even helped decide future leaders, leading to me
          being more decisive. Alongside that, given I worked with these 9
          people for the majority of 2 years, I learned how to collaborate
          effectively and compromise to reach an end goal. We always had
          disagreements, but we respected each others’ opinions and tried to
          come to a general consensus. But beyond the obvious 2 benefits of
          being a leader, I learned a far more important skill: practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most inexperienced leaders have many amazing ideas. They have
          elaborate plans about how to revolutionize their organization and
          imagine events that are fantastic on paper. Almost none of those ideas
          actually come to fruition. It’s like that episode from Parks and Rec,
          where Chris tries to change the entire department structure, but at
          the end, nothing sticks. As leaders, we all had ideas like that to
          improve our club. But, by the end of my captainship, I’d learned the
          value of practicality. It doesn’t matter how amazing an idea is; if
          it’s not implementable or too grandiose, it won’t really help the
          club. The small, incremental steps are what really benefit the club. I
          wouldn’t have learnt this if I hadn’t been offered a leadership
          position in this club. Thus, these skills are why student-led clubs
          are important — they teach the leaders important life lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, the benefits extend beyond the leaders. The team camaraderie is
          much stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key reasons why is approachability. Students are much less
          likely to voice their concerns to a teacher — it’s awkward and they
          may not know them that well. This is especially problematic with
          students who feel they aren’t good enough for a certain club, but are
          too afraid to approach the teacher for advice. However, student
          leaders? They’re likely to not only know the students much better, but
          can also offer advice based on their own recent experiences. Students
          are much more likely to go to other students for advice and support,
          and it ultimately strengthens the bond within the team. Another great
          reason why student-led clubs help everyone: they’re much more
          flexible. As leaders, we were able to quickly implement suggestions we
          got from other students. A great example of this benefit happened when
          a student suggested we alter how we divided up math problems in a team
          competition, resulting in our scores rising. In my experience, other
          clubs were much more rigid in their ways. Any change had to go through
          the coaches, who were usually busy with a lot of other tasks and
          didn’t respond to emails as often, leading to less growth in the club.
          In contrast, students usually gave me suggestions through Discord,
          which I could readily implement the next day. And when results come,
          every student feels they had a role in that process. Their team spirit
          is much stronger because of the more involved nature of the club. In
          summary, the students don’t feel disconnected from the leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let’s say you’re convinced now and want to transition your club to
          be student-led — how do you go about accomplishing this? The first
          step is to talk to your club sponsor. Approach them with the idea and
          the benefits you believe it will bring to the organization. You can
          propose it as a one-year trial, where the teacher would figure out if
          it was worth it or not at the end of the year. The teacher’s
          responsibility would mainly shift towards handling logistics. The most
          important part of this plan, though, is making sure you display your
          maturity. Make the teacher confident that you’ll be able to handle all
          the responsibilities associated with the club. And don’t try to do
          this alone. Get other people who you know are capable of leading; it’s
          kinda boring by yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, student-led clubs are a win-win for both the club and the
          students themselves. Of course, there is a certain level of maturity
          required for this process. The leaders must understand the
          responsibility they’ve been handed, otherwise most of the benefits
          disappear. But, such an organization structure really helps our
          students and accomplishes the point of clubs: to further the high
          school experience.

        <p>
          I….actually ended up switching high schools after sophomore year. A
          combination of factors led to that decision, but one of the things I
          regretted most at the time were the club opportunities at my new
          school. They didn’t have a Congressional Debate team, something I’d
          spent 2 years on but now seemed completely wasted. To somewhat
          continue my debate skills, though, I joined Model UN. One of the best
          decisions of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model UN is a club that attempts to simulate the actual United
          Nations. At competitions, you choose to join a committee, like the
          World Health Organization, and represent a nation such as the United
          States. Your job is to use your country’s policies to address the
          topics given by the committee. You give speeches on the subjects,
          negotiate with other countries on solutions, and ultimately write
          resolution papers that you try to get passed. While some people (me)
          love the more real-life topics, such as climate change, there are a
          few…interesting committees. For example, you could represent Squidward
          in the Spongebob committee, where the topic is the secret formula
          being stolen. Model UN as a whole, therefore, is very flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I instantly fell in love with Model UN. Even though my first
          conference was virtual, I really enjoyed the format of the competition
          and the style of debate. By the end of senior year, with 2 in-person
          conferences, I’d been convinced Model UN was a must for every single
          student. It isn’t just that the food at conferences is insanely good;
          the skills you developed through conferences are immensely beneficial.
          Let me explain.
        </p>
        <p>1. Collaboration</p>
        <p>
          Here’s the thing. Model UN is a very collaboration-focused club. You
          have to work with other countries to develop solutions, and they are
          going to disagree with you. Through Model UN, you learn the art of
          compromising, finding a middle ground that allows everyone to work
          towards their goals. In one of my committees, we spent 4 days trying
          to negotiate details that worked with everyone writing the solution.
          We argued over minor things like the details of one sentence, or more
          significant aspects like the enforcement mechanisms. But, by the end
          of the conference, we had a paper that somehow incorporated the views
          of 20 different nations. This kind of intense collaboration is the
          hallmark of Model UN.
        </p>
        <p>2. Leadership</p>
        <p>
          The key to winning a Model UN conference is establishing yourself as
          the leader of the committee. The chair of the committee (who decides
          the winner of the conference) looks for delegates that are not only
          stating their ideas, but also convincing others to support them.
          Whether that be through eloquent speeches, negotiation with other
          nations, or being able to respond to criticism and questions with
          confidence, going to just one conference allows you to see how other
          people implement these ideas. It’s hard to improve in leadership
          without looking at others for inspiration, but by observing more
          advanced delegates and trying to understand their techniques for
          winning over the committee, you really become a better leader through
          these competitions. After 1–2 competitions, you’ll be able to
          implement these skills and gain confidence in your leadership.
        </p>
        <p>3. Ingenuity</p>
        <p>
          The core of Model UN is trying to address issues our society faces
          right now. The beauty of the competition is that YOU develop solutions
          to solve these problems. The committee only provides the problem;
          you’re the person actively making a difference, and you’re rewarded
          for bringing up creative and innovative ideas. For example, in one of
          my committees concerning poverty, I brought up a simple solution of
          the UN supporting the development of prefabricated homes. These houses
          are built off-site and then shipped to the destination, a process that
          makes them significantly more affordable. Model UN pushes you to think
          outside the box for such solutions to address the problems we have,
          allowing you to develop your ingenuity.
        </p>
        <p>4. Communication</p>
        <p>
          Lastly, and I think this is pretty obvious, your communication skills
          greatly benefit from this club. Most Model UN speeches are only 30
          seconds to 1 minute long, and you don’t have too much time to prepare.
          This teaches you how to be concise and speak impromptu in front of
          others, while also making you more confident in public speaking. At
          beginner conferences, there are often numerous opportunities to speak
          (sometimes upwards of 10), so you have plenty of chances to develop
          your abilities. Alongside that, you have to write a 1-pager on your
          country’s history/ideas for the given subject at every conference,
          which the chair often gives feedback on to improve your writing.
          Furthermore, you often work in small groups in conferences. This
          encourages deeper conversations that let you develop clarity in your
          speaking, since you need everyone to understand your ideas.
          Communication, therefore, is an essential part of Model UN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, here’s why these skills matter. Everything I mentioned are some
          of the top skills employers look for in hiring, according to this
          article from Indeed. By working on them early on, you’ll be more
          prepared going into the workforce, while also being more knowledgeable
          about global issues. You accomplish this in a relatively enjoyable
          learning experience, something that I can’t really say about most
          other clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Model UN is seriously worth it for any student. No matter
          what your future plans are (I’m literally majoring in math), it will
          greatly benefit your education and high school experience. Trust me,
          it won’t be boring. You will love it.
